# R Data Automation Mini-Tool

This repository contains a simple R script built to automate early-stage data cleaning and exploratory analysis for structured CSV datasets.

## What This Tool Does
- Loads raw CSV data
- Detects missing values by column
- Standardises numeric variables
- Generates summary statistics
- Exports a cleaned dataset for downstream analysis or modelling

## Why I Built This
I built this tool to reduce repetitive manual preprocessing and to better understand how automation improves data readiness for machine learning workflows. This project reflects my early-stage learning in R, data pipelines, and analytics automation.

## How to Use
1. Place your raw dataset in the same folder as the script.
2. Rename your dataset to `raw_data.csv`.
3. Run `data_cleaning_automation.R`.
4. A cleaned file named `cleaned_data.csv` will be generated automatically.

## Tools Used
- R (base functions)
